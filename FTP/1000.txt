<alj_decision> <p/><b>INITIAL DECISION</b> <p/><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <p/>On August 7, 2014, the appellant, an Admin/Tech Specialist with the Department of the Navy (DON), located in Newport, Rhode Island filed a timely appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board) challenging the agency's decision to furlough him for no more than 11 workdays between July 8 and September 30, 2013. <i>See</i> Initial Appeal File (IAF), Tab 1. <p/>For the reasons stated below, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Because appellant failed to establish a factual dispute bearing on the issue of jurisdiction, the hearing that he requested was not held. <i>See </i><cite><i>Pervez v. Department of the Navy</i>, 193 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999)</cite>; <cite><i>Hardy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</i>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</cite>. <p/><b>JURISDICTION</b> <br/><br/><u>Background</u> <p/>In his appeal, the appellant indicated that at the time of the furlough he was a competitive service probationary employee who had been employed with the agency for seven months. <i>See</i> IAF, Tab 1. On December 10, 2014, the agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <i>See id</i>., Tab 3. On December 11, 2014, I issued an Order to Show Cause notifying the appellant of the specific jurisdictional issues which were raised in this appeal and of his burden of proof. <i>See id</i>., Tab 4. The appellant did not file any response to the Order to Show Cause. <br/><br/><u>Applicable Law and Burden of Proof</u>. <p/>The Board's jurisdiction is limited, not plenary; the Board has jurisdiction only granted to it by law, rule, or regulation. <i>See</i> <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(1)</cite>; <i>see also </i><cite><i>Goines v. Merit Systems Protection Board</i>, 258 F.3d 1289, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2001)</cite>; <cite><i>Chase-Baker v. Department of Justice</i>, 198 F.3d 843, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1999)</cite>. Whether an individual in the competitive service has the right to appeal an adverse action depends on whether he is an "employee" under <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1)(A)</cite>. <i>See </i><cite><i>Williams v. Department of Defense</i>, 96 M.S.P.R. 335, P 7 (2004)</cite>. That statutory provision defines an "employee" as "an individual in the competitive service (i) who is not serving a probationary ... period under an initial appointment...; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less." <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1)(A)</cite>. If the appellant has completed one year of current, continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, then he satisfied the requirements of <cite>section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)</cite>. "Current, continuous service" means service immediately prior to the action at issue with no break in service. <i>See </i><cite><i>Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury</i>, 89 M.S.P.R. 495, P 6 (2001)</cite>; <cite><i>Carr v. U.S. Postal Service</i>, 44 M.S.P.R. 681, 683 (1990)</cite>. Under <cite><i>McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</i>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2002)</cite>, <i>pet. for reh'g en banc denied</i>, <cite>329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003)</cite>, <cite>subsections (a)(1)(A)(i)</cite> and <cite>(a)(1)(A)(ii)</cite> are alternative avenues of jurisdiction; in other words, an individual is an "employee" with Board appeal rights if one or both of these provisions are satisfied. <i>See also </i><cite><i>Williams</i>, 96 M.S.P.R. 335, P 7</cite>. <p/>The appellant has the burden of establishing, by preponderant evidence, that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. <i>See</i> <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.56(a)(2)(i)</cite>; <i>see also </i><cite><i>Hogan v. Department of the Navy</i>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000)</cite>; <cite><i>Covington v. Department of the Army</i>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, P 9 (2000)</cite>. Preponderant evidence is defined as the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. <i>See</i> <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.56(c)(2)</cite>. <br/><br/><u>The Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal under <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)</cite></u>. <p/>The Board might have jurisdiction under <cite>section 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)</cite> if the appellant has completed his probationary period. Here, it is undisputed that he was furloughed during his one-year probationary period. <i>See</i> IAF, Tabs 1 and 3. I therefore find that he did not meet the statutory definition of employee under <cite>section 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)</cite>. <i>See </i><cite><i>Williams</i>, 96 M.S.P.R. 335, P 9</cite>. <br/><br/><u>The Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal under <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)</cite></u>. <p/>If the appellant has completed one year of current, continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, then he satisfied the requirements of <cite>section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)</cite>. "Current, continuous service" means service immediately prior to the action at issue with no break in service. <i>See </i><cite><i>Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury</i>, 89 M.S.P.R. 495, P 6 (2001)</cite>; <cite><i>Carr v. U.S. Postal Service</i>, 44 M.S.P.R. 681, 683 (1990)</cite>. Here, the appellant has not shown or even alleged that at the time of the furlough action, he had one year of current, continuous service in other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. <i>See</i> IAF, Tab 1. Consequently, I find that he failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of <cite>section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)</cite>. <i>See </i><cite><i>Williams</i>, 96 M.S.P.R. 335, PP 11-13</cite>. <br/><br/><u>Conclusion</u> <p/>In summary, I find that the appellant did not establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal under any law, rule, or regulation. Accordingly, I cannot review the merits of this appeal. <p/><b>DECISION</b> <p/>The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. <br/><br/>FOR THE BOARD: <p/>Maureen Briody <p/>Administrative Judge <p/><b>NOTICE TO APPELLANT</b> <p/>This initial decision will become final on <b><u>February 10, 2015</u></b>, unless a petition for review is filed by that date. This is an important date because it is usually the last day on which you can file a petition for review with the Board. However, if you prove that you received this initial decision more than 5 days after the date of issuance, you may file a petition for review within 30 days after the date you actually receive the initial decision. If you are represented, the 30-day period begins to run upon either your receipt of the initial decision or its receipt by your representative, whichever comes first. You must establish the date on which you or your representativereceived it. The date on which the initial decision becomes final also controls when you can file a petition for review with the Court of Appeals. The paragraphs that follow tell you how and when to file with the Board or the federal court. These instructions are important because if you wish to file a petition, you must file it within the proper time period. <p/><b>BOARD REVIEW</b> <p/>You may request Board review of this initial decision by filing a petition for review if you believe that the settlement agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. Your petition, with supporting evidence and argument, must be filed with Clerk of the Board at the address below. <p/>If the other party has already filed a timely petition for review, you may file a cross petition for review. Your petition or cross petition for review must state your objections to the initial decision, supported by references to applicable laws, regulations, and the record. You must file it with: <super-indent> <p/>The Clerk of the Board <p/>Merit Systems Protection Board <p/>1615 M Street, NW. <p/>Washington, DC 20419</super-indent> <br/><br/>A petition or cross petition for review may be filed by mail, facsimile (fax), personal or commercial delivery, or electronic filing. A petition submitted by electronic filing must comply with the requirements of <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.14</cite>, and may only be accomplished at the Board's e-Appeal website (https://e-appeal.mspb.gov). <p/><b><u>Criteria for Granting a Petition or Cross Petition for Review</u></b> <p/>Pursuant to <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.115</cite>, the Board normally will consider only issues raised in a timely filed petition or cross petition for review. Situations in which the Board may grant a petition or cross petition for review include, but are not limited to, a showing that: <p/>(a) The initial decision contains erroneous findings of material fact. (1) Any alleged factual error must be material, meaning of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision. (2) A petitioner who alleges that the judge made erroneous findings of material fact must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect and identify specific evidence in the record that demonstrates the error. In reviewing a claim of an erroneous finding of fact, the Board will give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing. <p/>(b) The initial decision is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation or the erroneous application of the law to the facts of the case. The petitioner must explain how the error affected the outcome of the case. <p/>(c) The judge's rulings during either the course of the appeal or the initial decision were not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, and the resulting error affected the outcome of the case. <p/>(d) New and material evidence or legal argument is available that, despite the petitioner's due diligence, was not available when the record closed. To constitute new evidence, the information contained in the documents, not just the documents themselves, must have been unavailable despite due diligence when the record closed. <p/>As stated in <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.114(h)</cite>, a petition for review, a cross petition for review, or a response to a petition for review, whether computer generated, typed, or handwritten, is limited to 30 pages or 7500 words, whichever is less. A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to 15 pages or 3750 words, whichever is less. Computer generated and typed pleadings must use no less than 12 point typeface and 1-inch margins and must be double spaced and only use one side of a page. The length limitation is exclusive of any table of contents, table of authorities, attachments, and certificate of service. A request for leave to file a pleading that exceeds the limitations prescribed in this paragraph must be received by the Clerk of the Board at least 3 days before the filing deadline. Such requests must give the reasons for a waiver as well as the desired length of the pleading and are granted only in exceptional circumstances. The page and word limits set forth above are maximum limits. Parties are not expected or required to submit pleadings of the maximum length. Typically, a well-written petition for review is between 5 and 10 pages long. <p/>If you file a petition or cross petition for review, the Board will obtain the record in your case from the administrative judge and you should not submit anything to the Board that is already part of the record. A petition for review must be filed with the Clerk of the Board no later than the date this initial decision becomes final, or if this initial decision is received by you or your representative more than 5 days after the date of issuance, 30 days after the date you or your representative actually received the initial decision, whichever was first. If you claim that you and your representative both received this decision more than 5 days after its issuance, you have the burden to prove to the Board the <u>earlier</u> date of receipt. You must also show that any delay in receiving the initial decision was not due to the deliberate evasion of receipt. You may meet your burden by filing evidence and argument, sworn or under penalty of perjury (<i>see</i> 5 C.F.R. Part 1201, Appendix 4) to support your claim. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date. The date of filing by fax or by electronic filing is the date of submission. The date of filing by personal delivery is the date on which the Board receives the document. The date of filing by commercial delivery is the date the document was delivered to the commercial delivery service. Your petition may be rejected and returned to you if you fail to provide a statement of how you served your petition on the other party. <i>See</i> <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.4(j)</cite>. If the petition is filed electronically, the online process itself will serve the petition on other e-filers. <i>See</i> <cite>5 C.F.R. § 1201.14(j)(1)</cite>. <p/>A cross petition for review must be filed within 25 days after the date of service of the petition for review. <p/><b>NOTICE TO AGENCY/INTERVENOR</b> <p/>The agency or intervenor may file a petition for review of this initial decision in accordance with the Board's regulations. <p/><b>NOTICE TO THE APPELLANT REGARDING YOUR FURTHER REVIEW RIGHTS</b> <p/>You have the right to request review of this final decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. You must submit your request to the court at the following address: <super-indent> <p/>United States Court of Appeals <p/>for the Federal Circuit <p/>717 Madison Place, N.W. <p/>Washington, DC 20439</super-indent> <br/><br/>The court must receive your request for review no later than 60 calendar days after the date this initial decision becomes final. <i>See</i> <cite>5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(1)(A)</cite> (as rev. eff. Dec. 27, 2012). If you choose to file, be very careful to file on time. The court has held that normally it does not have the authority to waive this statutory deadline and that filings that do not comply with the deadline must be dismissed. <i>See </i><cite><i>Pinat v. Office of Personnel Management</i>, 931 F.2d 1544 (Fed. Cir. 1991)</cite>. <p/>If you need further information about your right to appeal this decision to court, you should refer to the federal law that gives you this right. It is found in Title <cite>5 of the United States Code, section 7703</cite> (<cite>5 U.S.C. § 7703</cite>) (as rev. eff. Dec. 27, 2012). You may read this law as well as other sections of the United States Code, at our website, http://www.mspb.gov/appeals/uscode/htm. Additional information is available at the court's website, www.cafc.uscourts.gov. Of particular relevance is the court's "Guide for Pro Se Petitioners and Appellants," which is contained within the court's Rules of Practice, and Forms 5, 6, and 11.</alj_decision>
